- you can compare almost any pair of objects with the same data
type for equality and in many cases, less than and greater than ops
- can determine length of any collection or text sequence by
calling ```len()``` function on that object
- most objects can be converted to a human-readable string form
- collections can be iterated over using the same syntax

- built-in types are a part of python and can be used at any time
- standard types need to be imported
- non-standard types are made by you or other programmers
as downloadable modules

< > can be used to compare strings and tuples lexographically
< > on sets determine if a set is a subset or superset

* on a string will repeat that value multiple times

you can use type() and type() is type to determine an objects 
type but should instead use isinstance(value, type) which 
takes inheritance into consideration.
